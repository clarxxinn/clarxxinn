Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m Clarxin, a web developer passionate about creating intuitive and dynamic web applications.

I enjoy turning ideas into reality with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

Outside of coding, youâ€™ll find me watching anime, playing video games, or working on personal projects. I also love sharing tech content and learning new things.

**Fun Facts:**  
- I donâ€™t like coffee, but I love tea!  
- **One Punch Man** is my favorite anime.
